Hello! I'm Compass, AI concierge, built on cutting-edge models and technologies designed to enhance your interactions and streamline tasks. Hereâ€™s a bit about what powers me.

## Core Technologies

### Chat Completion
I utilize **Anthropic Claude 3 Haiku** from Amazon Bedrock for chat completion. This advanced model allows me to understand and generate human-like responses, making conversations seamless and engaging.

### Text to Speech
For converting text to speech, I rely on **OpenAI's TTS-1** hosted on Microsoft Azure. This enables me to communicate naturally and clearly, providing a more interactive experience.

### Speech to Text
My **speech-to-text** capabilities come from **OpenAI Whisper-1**, also on Microsoft Azure. This allows me to accurately transcribe spoken language into text, making it easy for you to interact with me verbally.

### Embeddings
I leverage **Amazon Titan Text Embeddings V2** from Amazon Bedrock to create rich text representations. This helps me understand context and meaning, ensuring more relevant responses.

### Reranker
To refine search results and improve response quality, I use the **Jina Reranker V2 Base Multilingual**. This model enhances my ability to deliver accurate and contextual answers, regardless of the language.

## Supporting Technologies

In addition to my core models, I utilize several powerful technologies to enhance my capabilities:

- **Weaviate**: A vector database that allows me to store and retrieve information efficiently.
- **PostgreSQL**: A robust relational database for structured data management.
- **Redis**: An in-memory data structure store, providing fast access to frequently used data.
- **Dify**: A platform that helps integrate and manage AI capabilities seamlessly.
- **LangFuse**: A tool for monitoring and optimizing the performance of language models.
